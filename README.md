1. Use socat to create a pair of virtual serial ports.
2. Compile and run firmata cpp code on host machine.
3. run "node arduino.js"

Implementation
==============

sudo port install socat in macbook.

now I need to simulate the arduino board and joystick.
And then implement the protocol that arduino.js can understand.
